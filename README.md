# Robotics

## CrustCrawler

* Dimixel motor
  * Cheap and not very precise
  * Can measure force on the motor
  * Can measure temperature
  
## Final projects

* Kinect/Force sensors
* Vision and ROS with at least 2 nodes

## Joints

* Prismatic (P)
* Revolute (R)

* SCARA. RRP Robot.
* Kinematic structure RRR Robot. Typical for Universal Robots.

* Spherical wrist. Easy for controlling movement.
* Prismatic for square automatic work area. Limited movement.

* Workspace

## important
* Degrees of freedom (DOF) (key concept)
* Industrial robots often have 6 joints

* Plane: 3 DOF
* Space: 4 DOF?

* Under actuated robot
    * Fewer DOF than neede

* Over actuated robot
    * Snake like robot that uses way more joints/DOF than needed
    
# meh

* forwar and inverse kinematics. degrees to hit the desired point.
